    <p className = 'about-paragraph'>Ghost Raps is an anonymous creative space for people to 
      collaborate on lyrics. Anyone can start a rap with a title and
      a few lines. Then, anyone can contribute by adding lines. So create 
      an account, get creative, be inspired! If all goes according to plan I'll sell 
      the best raps to Drake (jokes)  
      Shout out to <a href='//glowtxt.com'>Glowtxt</a> for the title image
