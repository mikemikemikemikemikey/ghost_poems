    <p className = 'about-paragraph'>Ghost Raps is an anonymous creative space for people to 
      collaborate on lyrics. Anyone can start a rap with a title and
      a few lines. Then, anyone can contribute by adding lines. So get 
      creative, be inspired! If all goes according to plan I'll sell 
      the best raps to Drake, so create an account, throw down some bars
      and keep an ear out if anything sounds familiar (jokes)  
      Shout out to <a href='glowtxt.com'>Glowtxt</a> for the title image
